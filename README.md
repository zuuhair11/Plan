# Plan
Get more deep using OOP JavaScript ES6 dealing with DOM as well
I've seeing most tutorial explaing the OOP but just using really basic examples like (Dog constructor Person and so on...)
And I want to do a reall project that I can get closer what OOP is exacly used for and y'know and how facilitate and make my project more readable
so yeah, this project maight seem foolish but again the whool point I just want to get my feet wet.
